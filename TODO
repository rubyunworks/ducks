= TODO

* Need to add Remote Ajax call functionality.

* Consider the extension name of duck scripts.

* Should Ducks be a jQuery-based system?
  jQuery can provide the Ajax. Or should it be
  framework agnostic?

* Try RubyJS as opposed to Red, see which one
  proves the best.

* Could Joose be useful?

* What about ruby.js?
