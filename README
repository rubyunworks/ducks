= Web Ducks

  http://ducks.rubyforge.org


== INTRODUCTION

Web Ducks may be the easiest way to create web applications.

The overarching idea of the Ducks Web Framework, is that everything is written
in Ruby. You do not create separate HTML files, CSS files, Javascripts files, etc.
So witht he exception of raw data, such as images, the whole site consists of
a set of ruby scripts. With these scripts one creates HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.
through ultra-high level DSLs.

The backend server is Rack-based.

Currently this project is very much a prototype.
